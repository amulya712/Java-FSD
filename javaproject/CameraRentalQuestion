Project Agenda: Build a peer-to-peer camera rental application

Scenario:
You have been hired by a company called rentmycam.io as a Full Stack Developer with the aim to create a prototype of a camera rental application

*Include the following operations in the application:*

.List a camera along with its brand, model, and per-day rental amount
.Select a camera from a listing to rent
.Add or view wallet amount
.Navigate from the current execution context to the main context
.Close the application

*Create a welcome screen with the application name and developer details
.Include options that the user can interact with to access various features of the    application
*Application features:
.The user can add a new camera, along with its details, to the existing camera list.
.The application can display the list of cameras available for rent.
.The list will include details like the camera brand, model, and per-day rent amount.
.The user can select a camera to rent for a day.
.The user will only be allowed to rent the camera if there is sufficient balance in the userâ€™s wallet to fulfil the per-day rent amount. If not, a message is returned.

*Insufficient wallet amount
.If there is sufficient balance, the amount will be deducted from the wallet.
.If the list of cameras is empty, an appropriate message is displayed: No Data Present at This Moment.
.The user can add or view the balance in the wallet through a sub-menu.
.The user can deposit an amount to increase the wallet balance.
.A message is displayed to indicate the status of the operation.
.The application implements concepts like exceptions, collections, and sorting techniques for source code optimization and increased performance.
